<h3><b>PURPOSE OF RESEARCH STUDY:</b></h3>
The goal of the project is to measure what makes particular aspects of language easier or harder to learn and understand. There are two parts in this study. In the first part you will be reading sentences (presented one word at a time) and answering questions about these sentences. In the second part you will be presented strings of characters and you have to determine if these are real words in English. 

<h3><b>RISKS/DISCOMFORTS:</b></h3>
